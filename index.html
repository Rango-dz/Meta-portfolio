                    <p>No two gardens are the same and no two people want the same garden.  It can be difficult to visualize how a garden is going to look and work. Our approach is to listen carefully to what our clients are looking for in terms of function, design and planting.  Working collaboratively, we develop a design brief and then shape the garden to meet their needs.</p>

                    <p>We also offer a landscape design service for larger country gardens and landscapes.  Our landscape design is known for its strong architectural lines, generous planting and elegant styling.  In the end, it is the relationship between the bone structure of the hard landscaping and good planting which makes a successful garden.

                        Our studio is in West London but our landscape design work extends across the UK and overseas.  </p>

                        Charlotte Rowe trained as a garden designer after a career in communications and marketing. She is now supported by a small team of landscape architects and garden designers.</p>
